Created Wednesday 24 April 2019

Twine-Server provides a basic collaborative environment for working with the Twine2 nonlinear story editor.
This document outlines the design decisions and REST API defined for the server.

* [[+Api spec]]

===== Design goals =====
* Enable someone to work **exclusively **on a story, maybe having a lock in the story selection screen with the name of the person working on it.
* Enable **copying any story** as to let someone STILL work on a story despite someone else working on it too.
* Enable the storing and loading of stories (it is required to have multiple possible stories).
* Keep the ability to import locally the story.
