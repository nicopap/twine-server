====== Overview ======
Created Wednesday 24 April 2019

Twine-Server provides a basic collaborative environment for working with the Twine2 nonlinear story editor.
This document outlines the design decisions and REST API defined for the server.

* [[+Api spec]]
* [[+Story locker design]]

===== Design goals =====
* Enable someone to work **exclusively **on a story, maybe having a lock in the story selection screen with the name of the person working on it.
* Enable **copying any story** as to let someone STILL work on a story despite someone else working on it too.
* Enable the storing and loading of stories (it is required to have multiple possible stories).
* Keep the ability to import locally the story.

===== Open questions =====
* What if someone creates a new story and someone else is on the story list screen? The list should be updated?
* What if someone "locks" a story while someone else is at the story screen? The list doesn't reflect the actual state of the server. => Solution: display an error when attempting to open a locked story, and when that happens, request from server updated story listing.
* Is this generic enough to be adaptable to other workflows?
* Does a generic dead-simple similar server exists?
